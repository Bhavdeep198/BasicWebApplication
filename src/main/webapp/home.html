	<h3> The importance of new business models, the need for money to play with,
	 and how to cast” the ultimate mix of functions and users—invite twenty city makers 
	 to share their thoughts in a virtual conference, and they’ll give you an abundance of 
	 tips on nurturing successful cultural and creative hubs.</h3>
	<h3 > Art and culture are one of the most promising avenues to revitalize cities and neighborhoods. But to succeed as a driving force for lasting and equitable area development, what do incubators, cultural houses and creative hubs need? In a recent virtual meet-up, I worked with twenty fellow Dutch city makers to identify tools that city makers, governments, and developers can use to help their cities thrive. From theatre directors to developers to founders to researchers, each brought their own experiences in culture houses and creative hubs to the table.

This adventure started almost by accident, with a "call for best practices" on LinkedIn to help as inspiration for two of my projects: new cultural hubs in the cities of Amsterdam and Eindhoven. An overwhelming flow of responses, not only with examples, but also with interest in sharing knowledge and experiences, prompted me to organize this peer-to-peer session. This article contains the findings of the first session, and a second session is already in the works. </h3>
